      <p>I'm predominantly a software developer by trade.  I'm self taught having been terribly underprepared for 
      development with a psychology degree.  Most of my experience is in Microsoft technologies but my 
      Ruby/Rails abilities are quickly expanding.</p>

      <h4>I'm a writer</h4>

      <p>Note, I did not say I'm an author though when I get something published, I'll be sure to update this
      accordingly.  I've always felt comfortable with the written word and I have the 500 word emails to
      prove it, much to my coworkers chagrin.</p>
