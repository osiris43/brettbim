      <h4><a href="/work">I'm a software developer</a></h4>
      <p>I'm predominantly a software developer by trade.  I'm self taught having been terribly underprepared for 
      development with a psychology degree.  Most of my experience is in Microsoft technologies but my 
      Ruby/Rails abilities are quickly expanding.</p>

      <h4><%= link_to("I'm a writer", writing_path) %></h4>
      <p>Note, I did not say I'm an author though when I get something published, I'll be sure to update this
      accordingly.  I've always felt comfortable with the written word and I have the 500 word emails to
      prove it, much to my coworkers chagrin.</p>

      <h4><%= link_to("I'm a CrossFitter", "http://www.crossfit.com") %></h4>
      <p>What this means to me and what this means to my friends and family are two entirely different things
      summarized as they think I'm insane and I don't.
      I've been doing CrossFit since August, 2008 and got my Level I Certificate in September 2009.  I 
      occasionally train people in the CrossFit methodolgy and am always willing to discuss the benefits of
      CrossFit.</p>
